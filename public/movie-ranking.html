<h1>The Best Movies According To Bilal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sound Of Metal</h3>
<p>"Sound of Metal" is a powerful and relatable film that artfully explores the emotional journey of deafness. I deeply connected with Ruben's struggles and found the movie's portrayal of deafness and helplessness to be profoundly authentic and enlightening. A must-watch for its compelling storytelling and exceptional performances.</p>
<h3>Banshees Of Insherin</h3>
<p>Humans are lonely creatures, some embrace it while some seek comfort in others. Banshees of inisherin puts in shade, all the colors of human relationships through beautiful cinematic scenes and storylines. I seeked comfort off of many of these characters as there was in fact some part of me that could understand and relate to them. Dominic from the movie was perhaps the most saddening bit when it came to a story of a boy with limited prospects trying to dream. We all felt limited and seeked out something truly far and failed. It's miserable and sad and the movie portrays just that!!</p>
<h3>There will be blood</h3>
<p>This film exemplifies an artistic approach by personifying an ideal, depicting Mr. Plainview as a symbolic representation of capitalism and its detrimental impact on contemporary society. The poignant portrayal of the oil fire scene effectively conveys the insidious nature of capitalism, gradually corroding societies at large. Additionally, the movie explores diverse themes such as the clash between religion and business, which can have devastating consequences. Regarding technical aspects, the cinematography, music, and acting are flawlessly executed. Every frame harmonizes seamlessly, captivating the audience. It is a must-see for introspective viewers who enjoy deriving their own interpretations from movies.</p>
